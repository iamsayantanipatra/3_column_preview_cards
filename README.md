### Continued development
I would be more focusing on css grids and flexboxs, learning more about sass/scss, javascript,bootstrap also

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://w3schools.com) - This helped me to understand the media queries. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/columns) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS Columns. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
